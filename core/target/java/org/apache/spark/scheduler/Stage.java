package org.apache.spark.scheduler;
/**
 * A stage is a set of independent tasks all computing the same function that need to run as part
 * of a Spark job, where all the tasks have the same shuffle dependencies. Each DAG of tasks run
 * by the scheduler is split up into stages at the boundaries where shuffle occurs, and then the
 * DAGScheduler runs these stages in topological order.
 * <p>
 * Each Stage can either be a shuffle map stage, in which case its tasks' results are input for
 * another stage, or a result stage, in which case its tasks directly compute the action that
 * initiated a job (e.g. count(), save(), etc). For shuffle map stages, we also track the nodes
 * that each output partition is on.
 * <p>
 * Each Stage also has a jobId, identifying the job that first submitted the stage.  When FIFO
 * scheduling is used, this allows Stages from earlier jobs to be computed first or recovered
 * faster on failure.
 * <p>
 * The callSite provides a location in user code which relates to the stage. For a shuffle map
 * stage, the callSite gives the user code that created the RDD being shuffled. For a result
 * stage, the callSite gives the user code that executes the associated action (e.g. count()).
 * <p>
 * A single stage can consist of multiple attempts. In that case, the latestInfo field will
 * be updated for each attempt.
 * <p>
