/**
 * Coalesce the partitions of a parent RDD (<code>prev</code>) into fewer partitions, so that each partition of
 * this RDD computes one or more of the parent ones. It will produce exactly <code>maxPartitions</code> if the
 * parent had more than maxPartitions, or fewer if the parent had fewer.
 * <p>
 * This transformation is useful when an RDD with many partitions gets filtered into a smaller one,
 * or to avoid having a large number of small tasks when processing a directory with many files.
 * <p>
 * If there is no locality information (no preferredLocations) in the parent, then the coalescing
 * is very simple: chunk parents that are close in the Array in chunks.
 * If there is locality information, it proceeds to pack them with the following four goals:
 * <p>
 * (1) Balance the groups so they roughly have the same number of parent partitions
 * (2) Achieve locality per partition, i.e. find one machine which most parent partitions prefer
 * (3) Be efficient, i.e. O(n) algorithm for n parent partitions (problem is likely NP-hard)
 * (4) Balance preferred machines, i.e. avoid as much as possible picking the same preferred machine
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, it is assumed that the parent RDD may have many partitions, e.g. 100 000.
 * We assume the final number of desired partitions is small, e.g. less than 1000.
 * <p>
 * The algorithm tries to assign unique preferred machines to each partition. If the number of
 * desired partitions is greater than the number of preferred machines (can happen), it needs to
 * start picking duplicate preferred machines. This is determined using coupon collector estimation
 * (2n log(n)). The load balancing is done using power-of-two randomized bins-balls with one twist:
 * it tries to also achieve locality. This is done by allowing a slack (balanceSlack) between two
 * bins. If two bins are within the slack in terms of balance, the algorithm will assign partitions
 * according to locality. (contact alig for questions)
 * <p>
