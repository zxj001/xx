package org.apache.spark.shuffle;
/**
 * Manages assigning disk-based block writers to shuffle tasks. Each shuffle task gets one file
 * per reducer (this set of files is called a ShuffleFileGroup).
 * <p>
 * As an optimization to reduce the number of physical shuffle files produced, multiple shuffle
 * blocks are aggregated into the same file. There is one "combined shuffle file" per reducer
 * per concurrently executing shuffle task. As soon as a task finishes writing to its shuffle
 * files, it releases them for another task.
 * Regarding the implementation of this feature, shuffle files are identified by a 3-tuple:
 *   - shuffleId: The unique id given to the entire shuffle stage.
 *   - bucketId: The id of the output partition (i.e., reducer id)
 *   - fileId: The unique id identifying a group of "combined shuffle files." Only one task at a
 *       time owns a particular fileId, and this id is returned to a pool when the task finishes.
 * Each shuffle file is then mapped to a FileSegment, which is a 3-tuple (file, offset, length)
 * that specifies where in a given file the actual block data is located.
 * <p>
 * Shuffle file metadata is stored in a space-efficient manner. Rather than simply mapping
 * ShuffleBlockIds directly to FileSegments, each ShuffleFileGroup maintains a list of offsets for
 * each block stored in each file. In order to find the location of a shuffle block, we search the
 * files within a ShuffleFileGroups associated with the block's reducer.
