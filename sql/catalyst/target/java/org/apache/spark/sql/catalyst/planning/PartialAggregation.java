/**
 * Matches a logical aggregation that can be performed on distributed data in two steps.  The first
 * operates on the data in each partition performing partial aggregation for each group.  The second
 * occurs after the shuffle and completes the aggregation.
 * <p>
 * This pattern will only match if all aggregate expressions can be computed partially and will
 * return the rewritten aggregation expressions for both phases.
 * <p>
 * The returned values for this match are as follows:
 *  - Grouping attributes for the final aggregation.
 *  - Aggregates for the final aggregation.
 *  - Grouping expressions for the partial aggregation.
 *  - Partial aggregate expressions.
 *  - Input to the aggregation.
