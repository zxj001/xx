   * releases.  This execution is only exposed to provide an interface for inspecting the various
   * phases for debugging purposes.  Applications should not depend on particular phases existing
   * or producing any specific output, even for exactly the same query.
   * <p>
   * Additionally, the RDD exposed by this execution is not designed for consumption by end users.
   * In particular, it does not contain any schema information, and it reuses Row objects
   * internally.  This object reuse improves performance, but can make programming against the RDD
   * more difficult.  Instead end users should perform RDD operations on a SchemaRDD directly.
